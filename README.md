# Learning Algorithm Optimization Platform (LAOP)

We developed the LAOP to help researchers and students build deep learning models. This platform makes it easy to develop, test and compare deep learning algorithm models.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* JDK > 1.8
* Maven

### Installing

1. Install the LAOP from Git
    ```
    > git clone https://github.com/lool01/LAOP_alpha.git
    ```
1. Install the dependencies using Maven
    ```
    > cd LAOP_alpha
    > mvn install
    ```
1. Run the graphical interface runing the main method of **org.lrima.laop.core.App27Laop**


## Built With

* [Java 8](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The programming language used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [JavaFX](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/overview/index.html) - Library used for the UI of the application
* [DeepLearning4J](https://deeplearning4j.org) - Library used to code some deep learning algorithms coming with the platform
