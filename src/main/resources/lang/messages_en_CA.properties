text-entry=Learning Algorithm Optimization Platform (LAOP) is an open-source platform that aims to help researchers and students develop and compare their deep learning algorithms. Coupled with the Learning Algorithm Sharing Platform (LASP), it is easy for researchers to share their algorithms and find new ones to test against. These platforms were developed in the Laboratoire de Recherche Informatique de Maisonneuve. You can learn more about them on our github page.
